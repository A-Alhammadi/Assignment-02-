Part 2 (Abstract and Derived Classes):
When you run the program, you will be given 2 options: Enter 1 for a professional employee and enter 2 for a nonprofessional employee.

If option 1 (professional employee) is chosen, you will be asked to enter the professional employee's salary, then the number of vacation days, then the yearly health insurance amount. These will be printed on screen and saved as private variables in the professional employee class (derived from the base class: Employee).

If option 2 (nonprofessional employee) is chosen, you will be asked to enter the amount of hours the employee works per week. Using this number, the functions will calculate the weekly salary, yearly vacation days and monthly insurance. The results will be printed on screen and saved as private variables in the nonprofessional employee class (derived from the base class: Employee).
